## Features
- Tasks are grouped and colour coded by phase along the vertical axis 
- Tasks are rendered along the horizontal axis by time
- Task dependencies are illustrated with directed arrows. Dependency is configured as a comma separated list of task IDs in the 'dependencies' column (if source is a Power BI data table) or'dependencies' attribute (if source data is a JSON array defined in 'data' attribute).  
- Multi dimensional time axis (**Year / Quarter / Month / date**)
- Pick/change a time unit of interest from the drop down
- Phase bars are shown as a transparent outline by the phase colour whereas task bars have an opaque fill corresponding to a task's phase colour  
- A RollUp is performed on all tasks in that phase and percent completion of the phase is computed by aggregating all tasks by phase.
- On mouseover a task bar displays a popup with task details (start, end , days & progress %)
- On mouseover a phase bar displays the rolled up phase summary.
- Use horizontal and vertical browser scrollbars to view full extent.
